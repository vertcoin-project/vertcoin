## Vertcoin Security

We take security very seriously at Vertcoin. We welcome any peer review of our 100% open source code to ensure that the Vertcoin system is ever compromised or hacked.

### Where should I report security issues?

In order to give the community time to respond and upgrade we strongly urge you report all security issues privately. Please use our [vulnerability disclosure program at Hacker One](https://hackerone.com/vertcoin) to provide details and repro steps and we will respond ASAP. If you prefer not to use Hacker One, email us directly at `contact@vertcoin.org` with details and repro steps. Security issues *always* take precedence over bug fixes and feature work. We can and do mark releases as "urgent" if they contain serious security fixes.
