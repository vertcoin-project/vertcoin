# This is the official list of team members who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Vertcoin Core repository.
# This file lists the copyright holders, too.
#
# Names should be added if the person is a team member.
#
# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Individual's name <submission email address> [GitHub / Twitter user name] (website)
#     Individual's name <submission email address> <email2> <emailN> [GitHub / Twitter user name] (website)
#
# An entry with multiple email addresses specifies that the
# first address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the other addresses should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with GitHub.

# Please keep the list in alphabetical order sorted.
